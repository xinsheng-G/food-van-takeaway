## Mockup APP Server

### Customer APP mockup


**Warning: Customer app mockup is deprecated in the latest version!**

Customer mockup functionalities are fulfilled by `customer_mock_up_controller.js` in `controller` folder and `customer_mock_up_router.js` in `router` folder.

Mockup interfaces ignored login interception to make it convenient for debugging, and customer id is hard-coded, but we have implemented login interception in the other route. For more information, see **Other features** below.

#### Mockup features:

***1. View menu of snacks (including pictures and prices):***

​	Request to the url below with GET method, then it will return html document for menu, you can add/remove line items there:

​	Input: van_name as a param at `https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/menu/:van_name`            

​    van_name param can be : `debug_van_name`,  `valve`,  `ubisoft`, `ea`...

   Input Example: https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/menu/debug_van_name

   Output: a html document of menu of snacks will show in the browser with 200 status.

​	Exception: If query database occurs a failure, show error message on the console.

***2. View details of a snack***

​	Request with a snack name with GET method, then it will return snack detail from database in JSON.

​	Input: snack_name as a param at `https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/snack_detail/:snack_name`    

​    snack_name param can be: `latte`, `plain_biscuit,` `fancy_biscuit`, `small_cake`, `big_cake`, `cappuccino`, `long_black`...

​    Input Example: https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/snack_detail/fancy_biscuit

​    Output: a JSON of snack details will show in the browser with 200 status

​    Exception: when a snack is not exist, returns a warning. If query database occurs a failure, show error message on the console.

***3. Customer starts a new order by requesting a snack***
    There are two ways to place a new order:

1. Request with a form via POST method, then it will place an order in database
   
   Input: x-www-form-urlencoded form, the key-value should be `snack_name: number`,  for example:
   
   ``` javascript
   fancy_biscuit: 2
   small_cake: 1
   latte: 3
   not_valid_snack_name: 66
   ```
   
   Send the form with POST method to https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/place_an_order/:van_name. 
   
   van_name param at the end of url can be changed, 
   
   
   
   Input example: https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/place_an_order/ubisoft or https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/place_an_order/valve
   
   
   
   Output: a JSON of an order entity will show in the browser with 200 status. The new order will be placed in database's orders collection.
   
   
   
2. Or, you can get access to https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer_mockup/menu/debug_van_name, in the html page, you can edit line items, then press `place an order` button to submit the form. In this way you can also place an order in the MongoDB and get a return in JSON.

    

#### Other features:

We have implemented more functionalities than requirements of the deliverable 2:

1. Login interceptor for place an order:

   User can see a menu of a van via https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/menu/debug_van_name, if the user hasn't logged in and press `place an order` button at this route, login interception will redirect the user to the login in page. 

   Login interceptor is based on session, which is defined in `login_interceptor.js` in `controller` folder

2. Login/register/logout:

   User can login via https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer/login, and register via https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer/register. 

   A customer acoount for debugging: admin@admin.com, password: admina

   You can see other RESTful routes for customer operations in `customer_router.js` file at `router` folder.

3. Map:

   User can see vans' position on the map in index via https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/, vans' position is rendered from database.

4. My orders:

   If one user has logged in, he/she can see orders have made via  https://project-t05-x3ra.herokuapp.com/customer/my_orders/,

   order records are from database.

   You can see other RESTful routes for order operations in `my_orders_router.js` file at `router` folder.

5. Others:

   You could check `controller` and `router` to see more features we have implemented for the project so far.
